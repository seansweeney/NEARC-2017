# 2017 Fall [NEARC](http://www.northeastarc.org/) Conference
## Presentation Details ##
**Title:** Using the ArcGIS API for Python in Cambridge  
**Time Slot:** Monday November 6, 2017 11:00am - 11:30am  
**Author:** Sean Sweeney, GIS Programmer Analyst, City of Cambridge  

**Abstract:**	The new ArcGIS API for Python has greatly simplified automation with ArcGIS Online and Portal for ArcGIS. It abstracts away most of the gory low-level details that used to be required to interact with the ArcGIS REST API. Get a brief overview of what the ArcGIS API for Python is and how it fits into the Esri developer ecosystem, and demos of some of the ways that Cambridge is trying take advantage of this new tool.
